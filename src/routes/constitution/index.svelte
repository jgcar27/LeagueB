    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of players and draft picks are allowed. Trades will process in 24hrs and will be reversed if under investigation for collusion. If a rush is needed for the trade, contact the commish. Tradable assets include players, draft picks, and FAAB $.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 80%. If FAAB is below $50, team will be frozen.</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 18 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids</li>
            <li>Third Offense – A league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps. Most likely removal from league.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>


        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>Any player traded from a team may not be re-acquired via trade within 6 weeks of the original trade. Any teams involved in this behavior will be subject to the aforementioned collusion punishments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.3 Trade Deadline</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>The trade deadline will be set for the Saturday of the week 11 games of the NFL season.</p>

     <h3 bind:this={oneFour}>1.4 Sleeper player positions</h3>
    
    <p>If a player has multiple positions posted on Sleeper, that player will be allowed to play at those positions(Think Taysom 2020).</p>
	
    
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2 Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year will be a linear draft in reverse order of the previous year’s regular season standings for League A. The 3 teams moving up from league B will be randomly assigned spots 1, 2 and 3. League B will be randomly assigned except for previous seasons "Punishment" winner, who will get 1.01 draft position.</p>

    
    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>If a trade is being made during the draft, one or both parties can alert the commissioner to pause the draft to allow for extra time to negotiate the trade.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical .5PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. The 1st and 2nd place team will receive a bye week in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will only last one week and the winner will advance. Week 18 will not be used.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>

        <li>Points For</li>

    </ol>

    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty in order to improve your draft position may be subject to punishment, including but not limited to the forfeiture of draft selections.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisioners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a yearly commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at $20. Dues are collected through Paypal, Venmo or in person. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of week 6. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, their team will be locked until payment is received.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
	
    <p>League A: $280</p>
   
    <ul>
    <p>1st place: $200</p>
    <p>2nd place: $80</p>
	</ul>
    <p>League B: $200</p>
	<ul>
	<p>1st place: $160</p>
        <p>2nd place: $40</p>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A ⅔ majority vote is required in order to raise league dues. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={eight}>Section 8 Loser Punishment</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={eightOne}>8.1 Losers</h3>
